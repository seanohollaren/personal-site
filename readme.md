A little lambda that serves a bit of static html.

## Deployment

First, install the only dependency (`serverless`) with `npm install`

Then, with your environment's aws credentials set up, deploy it using `serverless deploy`

Once the deploy finishes, visit the endpoint Serverless prints out to see your site.

If you make changes and want to re-deploy it, just run `serverless deploy` again.
